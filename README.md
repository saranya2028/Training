# Java Training - Company Specific Problems

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various Java problems that I solved during my 10-day company-specific training program. The problems cover different aspects of Java programming, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and real-world applications.

## Training Details
- **Duration:** 10 Days
- **Language:** Java
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Core Java concepts
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Exception handling and multithreading
  - File handling and database connectivity

## Problem List
Each problem is categorized based on its difficulty and topic:

1. **Basic Programs**
   - Hello World
   - Data types and variables
   - Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case)
   
2. **Loops and Arrays**
   - For, While, and Do-While loops
   - 1D and 2D arrays
   - Sorting and searching algorithms

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes and Objects
   - Inheritance and Polymorphism
   - Encapsulation and Abstraction
   
4. **Exception Handling & Multithreading**
   - Try-Catch blocks
   - Custom exceptions
   - Creating and managing threads

5. **Advanced Concepts**
   - File handling (reading/writing files)
   - JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)
   - Collections framework (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)

## How to Run the Code
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/java-training-solutions.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
