# Company Specific Training-Java Problems

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various Java problems that I solved during my 10-day company-specific training program. The problems cover different aspects of Java programming, including data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and real-world applications.

## Training Details
- **Duration:** 10 Days
- **Language:** Java
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Core Java concepts
  - Data structures and algorithms
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Exception handling and multithreading
  - File handling and database connectivity

## Problem List
Each problem is categorized based on its difficulty and topic:

1. **Basic Programs**
   - Hello World
   - Data types and variables
   - Conditional statements (if-else, switch-case)
   
2. **Loops and Arrays**
   - For, While, and Do-While loops
   - 1D and 2D arrays
   - Sorting and searching algorithms

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
